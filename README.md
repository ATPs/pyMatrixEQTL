# Matrix eQTL: Ultra Fast eQTL Analysis via Large Matrix Operations

Matrix eQTL is designed for fast eQTL analysis on large datasets.
Matrix eQTL can test for association between genotype
and gene expression using linear regression
with either additive or ANOVA genotype effects.
The models can include covariates to account for factors
as population stratification, gender, and clinical variables.
It also supports models with heteroscedastic and/or correlated errors,
false discovery rate estimation and
separate treatment of local (cis) and distant (trans) eQTLs.
